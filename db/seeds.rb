    'detail': "One of the best long-lasting liquid liners just got even better! Clio Waterproof Pen Liner has updated its popular liner to have an even darker pigment, a more precise application, and to last even longer. 
    The color has increased carbon black content to be darker and more vivid, and glide on smoother. The formula is now even more waterproof and long-lasting, thanks to the inclusion of polar resin, which contains stronger polymers to prolong adhesion. It dries to a matte finish that stays put through sweat, tears and whatever you can throw on it. 
    The new, more precise felt tip applicator is great for pinpointing exact lines and giving you maximum control. When you're done for the night, it easily removes with your oil-based cleanser!
